Thanks! I’ll create a structured draft for Tabme’s user guides. This will include a quick-start tutorial for casual users and an advanced section with tips for power users, highlighting Tabme’s unique features like sticky notes and drag-and-drop UX. I’ll use the guides from TabExtend and Toby as references. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.


# Tabme User Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to **Tabme**, a friendly Chrome extension that helps turn chaotic browsing into a structured experience. In this quick-start section, you’ll learn how to install Tabme and save your first tabs in just a few steps.

**Installation:** Add Tabme to Chrome by visiting the Chrome Web Store and clicking **Add to Chrome**. Once installed, Tabme will replace your new tab page (if you chose the full version). If you prefer not to override the new tab page, you can install **Tabme Mini**, which has all the same features but appears only when you click its toolbar icon. After installation, we recommend pinning the Tabme icon to your browser’s toolbar for easy access.

**Opening Tabme:** To launch Tabme, simply open a new tab in Chrome. You should see the Tabme interface instead of the usual new tab screen. If you’re using Tabme Mini, click the Tabme toolbar icon to open the interface in a new tab.

**Quick Tour of the Interface:** On the left side of Tabme, you will see an **Open Tabs** panel listing all the tabs currently open in your browser window. On the right side, you’ll find your **Saved Tabs and Folders** area, where you can organize bookmarks (saved tabs) into folders. At the top, there’s a **Search bar** that lets you find tabs quickly. You’ll also notice a couple of handy buttons near the search bar: a broom icon for cleaning up duplicate tabs, and a “box” icon for stashing all open tabs at once (we’ll cover these in detail later).

&#x20;*Tabme interface overview: Open tabs are listed on the left sidebar, while saved folders (like “Favorites” and other categories) appear on the right. The icons at the top (magnified) allow you to close duplicate tabs (broom icon with a count) or stash all open tabs into a folder (box icon).*

**Saving your first tab:** Let’s save a tab to get started. With Tabme open in a browser tab, click and hold one of the pages listed under **Open tabs** (left side) and **drag** it to the right side. If you drop it onto an existing folder, it will be saved there. If you drop it onto the **New Folder** area (or an empty space on the right), Tabme will create a new folder automatically and place the tab inside. Congratulations – you’ve just saved a tab for later!

Now that you’ve installed Tabme and saved a tab, you’re ready to explore its features in depth. In the next sections, we’ll dive into organizing your saved tabs, using notes, searching, and more.

## Saving and Managing Tabs

Saving tabs in Tabme is designed to be intuitive. Any time you find an interesting webpage you want to keep, you can save it into Tabme instead of leaving it open or bookmarking it in the default Chrome bar. Here’s how to save and manage your tabs:

* **Drag and Drop to Save:** Whenever Tabme is open (as your new tab page or via the icon), your currently open sites are listed in the left sidebar. To save one, just drag its title from the **Open Tabs** list and drop it into a folder on the right. You can also drag a tab into the blank **New Folder** space to create a new folder on the fly for that tab.
* **One-Click “Stash All”:** To save a whole session of many open tabs, use the **Stash All Tabs** feature. Click the *“stash”* button (the box or tray icon at the top of the Open Tabs panel) to **stash all open tabs** into a new folder at once. This is great for when you’re finishing a research session or need to quickly clear your browser — all your open pages will be saved as a group in Tabme for later.
* **Closing Saved Tabs:** Once you’ve stashed or saved some tabs in Tabme, you might want to close those pages in the browser to avoid clutter and free up memory. It’s safe to close them because they’re now saved in Tabme. You can always reopen them with a click (or use **Open All** to restore a group; more on that soon).
* **Opening Saved Tabs:** To open a saved tab, just click on it in your Tabme folder. The page will launch in your browser. By default, Tabme will open the link in the current tab (replacing the Tabme page). If you prefer to open it in a new tab, you can change this behavior in settings or simply **Ctrl+click / Cmd+click** the item to open it in a new tab.

> **Tip:** You can select and move **multiple tabs at once** in Tabme. Click and drag from an empty spot on the right pane to draw a selection box around several saved items, then drag the whole selection into a folder or another location. This is a fast way to reorganize or archive many items in one go.

* **Folder Actions – “Open All” and more:** Each folder in Tabme has a menu for additional actions. Right-click on a folder name (or click the three-dot menu if available) to see options like **Open All Tabs**, **Rename**, **Change Color**, **Archive Folder**, or **Delete Folder**. **Open All Tabs** will launch every tab in that folder at once — perfect for restoring a session or starting your work day with all necessary pages. Use the Rename option to give folders clear titles, and apply Color labels to make them stand out (see the next section).

Now that you know how to save individual tabs and whole sessions, let’s look at ways to organize those saved tabs so you can easily find them later.

## Organizing with Folders and Colors

Tabme uses **folders** to group related tabs, making it easy to organize your browsing life. You might create folders for projects, research topics, to-read articles, or anything you like. Here’s how to keep everything orderly:

* **Creating and Naming Folders:** You can create a new folder by dragging a tab into the **New Folder** area, as mentioned above, or by clicking a dedicated “Add Folder” button (if provided) and giving the folder a name. Good folder names help — for example, create a folder called **Travel Plans** for all your trip-related tabs, or **Work Project X** for a specific project’s resources.

* **Color Coding:** Assign colors to your folders to categorize and visually distinguish them. Tabme allows you to pick a color for each folder (for example, blue for work items, green for personal, etc.). To color-code a folder, right-click the folder name and select a color, or use the color picker icon if one is shown on the folder. The folder’s header or background will display that color, helping you scan for it quickly.

* **Spatial Arrangement:** You’re not stuck with a static list of folders — you can rearrange them in a way that makes sense to you. Drag and drop entire folders (grab them by their title bar) to reorder them on the Tabme board. For instance, you might keep your most-used folder at the top, or group related folders side by side. Tabme’s interface is flexible, so feel free to arrange folders to create clusters of related information.

* **Nested Groups or Categories:** If you have many folders, Tabme supports an extra layer of organization through **Spaces** (advanced feature covered later) or category headers. For example, you might have a header like “Work” with several project folders under it, and another header “Personal” with folders for your own interests. These headings (or Spaces) help break up your board into sections so it doesn’t become one long list.

* **Renaming and Removing Folders:** To rename a folder, simply right-click on its name (or double-click it) and choose **Rename**, then type the new name. To delete a folder entirely, use the **Delete** option in the same menu — but be careful, deleting a folder will remove all the tabs inside it from Tabme. If you think you might need those tabs again, use **Archive Folder** instead, which moves the folder out of sight without permanently erasing it.

> **Tip:** Develop a color scheme that works for you. For instance, you could mark all work-related folders in one color and leisure/hobby folders in another. Over time, the color coding becomes second nature — you’ll instantly recognize a pink folder as “Travel” or a green folder as “Learning”, which makes finding things that much quicker.

Organizing your saved tabs with meaningful folders and color codes will make your Tabme dashboard easy to navigate at a glance. Next, we’ll see how you can add notes to further enhance your organization.

## Using Sticky Notes

Sometimes you need to jot down a quick thought or reminder along with your tabs — this is where **Sticky Notes** come in. Tabme’s sticky notes let you save text notes right alongside your bookmarks so you have context or to-dos captured in one place.

* **Creating a Note:** To add a sticky note in Tabme, you can use the **Add Note** option. For example, you might find a button or context menu item labeled “Add Sticky Note” when you right-click inside a folder or on an empty area. Click that, and a blank note will appear ready for you to type. Alternatively, some users create a note by double-clicking in an empty space within a folder. (Each folder can hold both saved tabs and notes.)
* **Writing and Editing:** Once your sticky note appears, just start typing. You can write anything — a quick reminder (“Finish reading these articles by Friday”), a list of tasks related to the tabs in that folder, or an idea that struck you while browsing. The note saves automatically. You can come back and edit it anytime by clicking on it and typing.
* **Using Notes for Context:** Notes are great for adding context to a group of tabs. For instance, if you saved a bunch of recipe tabs in a folder, you could add a note at the top saying “Weekly Meal Plan Ideas.” Next time you open Tabme, that note reminds you what the collection was for. Some people use notes as simple to-do lists or as scratchpads for project ideas.
* **Color and Style (if available):** Tabme notes can often be color-tagged just like tabs or folders. If you want a note to stand out, try assigning it a highlight color or an emoji icon (check if the note editing toolbar allows this). For example, mark an urgent note in red or put a ✅ when a task is done. Keep the content short and clear for easy scanning.
* **Deleting Notes:** If you no longer need a sticky note, you can delete it just like a saved tab. Right-click on the note and choose **Delete Note** (or an equivalent option). Removing a note won’t affect any saved tabs; it only deletes that text item.

> **Tip:** Sticky Notes are perfect for tracking **to-dos or reminders**. You can create a checklist of things to do with your saved tabs (e.g., “Read article A, compare prices on site B, email C when done”). As you complete tasks, you can check them off or remove the note. This way, Tabme can double as a lightweight project planner in addition to a tab manager.

By mixing tabs and notes, Tabme lets you maintain not just the links you need but also the thoughts and plans that go with them, all in one organized workspace.

## Search and Smart Filtering

As your collection of tabs and notes grows, you’ll want a quick way to find things. Tabme’s **Smart Search** bar is your go-to tool for locating any page or note across all your Tabme content (and even your open tabs). It’s like having a spotlight for your browser clutter:

* **Using the Search Bar:** The search bar is prominently located at the top of the Tabme interface (it says *“Search in Tabme”*). Click on it and start typing keywords. Tabme will instantly filter and display results that match your query. You’ll see results from different categories – for instance, it can show matches from your open tabs, your saved folders, your archived items, or even recently closed tabs.
* **Keyboard Shortcut to Search:** For even faster access, you can hit the `Tab` key on your keyboard as soon as you open the Tabme page. Pressing `Tab` will shift focus from the browser’s address bar to Tabme’s search field (in most cases). You can then start typing without having to click the search box at all. This is very handy for power users who prefer keeping their hands on the keyboard.
* **What Search Covers:** Tabme’s search is comprehensive. It looks through the titles and URLs of **open tabs**, **saved tabs (bookmarks)**, **sticky notes text**, and even **recently closed tabs**. That means if you closed something an hour ago or archived a tab last week, a quick search can bring it back to your attention. For example, typing “report” might surface an open Google Doc titled “Report Draft”, a bookmark you saved earlier with “report” in the title, and a note where you mentioned “annual report”.
* **Filtering by State:** The search results often indicate the state of the item — whether it’s currently open, in a particular folder, or archived. You might see small labels or different icons for each type (e.g., an icon for open tabs vs. a bookmark icon for saved ones). While you don’t need to specify filters (Tabme searches all states by default), you can quickly visually scan the results and pick the item you need. Just hit **Enter** on a highlighted result or click it to jump to that tab or open it anew.
* **Clearing or Narrowing Search:** If your search returns too many results, try typing more specific terms. Search is usually case-insensitive and works as you type. To clear the search, click the “X” in the search bar or delete your query – your full list of tabs and folders will reappear.

> **Tip:** Use search instead of manually hunting through folders. For example, if you know you saved a recipe but can’t remember which folder you put it in, just type a key ingredient or the site name (like “Allrecipes” or “chicken”) into the search bar. Tabme will find the tab for you in seconds, saving you from opening each folder.

With Smart Search, no matter how many tabs you’ve saved or closed, you’re only a few keystrokes away from finding them. This makes Tabme a powerful tool for staying organized even as your saved content grows.

## Performance and Bulk Actions

Managing tabs isn’t just about organization – it’s also about keeping your browser fast and clutter-free. Tabme includes several **performance and bulk action** features to help with this:

* **Close Duplicate Tabs:** Ever notice you have the same page open multiple times? Tabme can detect duplicate open tabs and close the extras for you with a single click. Look for the **broom icon** at the top of the Open Tabs sidebar. If there’s a number on this icon, it means Tabme found duplicate tabs (for example, “2” indicates two duplicates). Clicking the broom will instantly close those duplicate tabs, leaving just one open. This keeps your browser running smoother and eliminates visual clutter.
* **Stash All Tabs in One Go:** When you have a lot of tabs open and want to start fresh, use **Stash All Tabs** (as mentioned earlier) to save everything. This bulk action scoops up every open tab and saves them into a new folder (often labeled with the date or a name you choose). It’s super useful before rebooting your computer or when you need to clear out a crowded window without losing your work. After stashing, you can manually close all the now-saved tabs (or simply close the browser window) knowing they’re preserved in Tabme.
* **Open All Tabs from a Folder:** This is the reverse of stashing. If you’ve saved a set of tabs in a folder (say you stashed last week’s research into a folder called “May 2025 Research”), you can restore them quickly. Use the **Open All Tabs** option on that folder (via right-click menu or a button) to launch every tab inside. Tabme will open each saved page in your browser. This bulk open is handy for starting a session with a predefined set of sites.
* **Bulk Select and Move:** As noted earlier, you can lasso-select multiple items and perform bulk actions. After selecting a group of items (tabs or notes), you could drag them all to another folder, or archive them all at once. This beats doing the same action on each item one by one.
* **Memory and Performance Benefits:** Remember that every tab you save (and close in the browser) is one less tab eating up memory. Using Tabme to offload tabs can significantly improve Chrome’s performance if you tend to keep many tabs open. Additionally, features like duplicate closing and session stashing ensure that you aren’t running in circles with the same pages open unnecessarily.

> **Tip:** Make it a habit to “stash and sweep” at the end of the day. Use **Stash All** to save your current session, then hit the duplicate **broom icon** to clean up any repeats. Finally, close those now-saved tabs in Chrome. Next time you start fresh, you can retrieve what you need from Tabme, and your browser will thank you with faster load times.

By taking advantage of these bulk actions and performance-oriented tools, you’ll keep both your Tabme library and your browser lean and efficient.

## Tips for Power Users

Ready to level up your Tabme game? This section covers advanced tips and keyboard shortcuts for those who want to work even faster and organize even more efficiently. While Tabme is easy to use with a mouse, mastering a few shortcuts and advanced features can save you a lot of time:

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Navigation

If you prefer keyboard navigation, Tabme has you covered. Here are some useful shortcuts:

| **Action**                  | **Shortcut (Windows)** | **Shortcut (Mac)** |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Open Tabme (new tab page)   | `Ctrl + T`             | `⌘ + T`            |
| Focus Tabme’s search bar    | `Tab`                  | `Tab`              |
| Navigate through items      | Arrow ↑/↓ keys         | Arrow ↑/↓ keys     |
| Open selected tab or folder | `Enter`                | `Enter`            |
| Close Tabme (current tab)   | `Ctrl + W`             | `⌘ + W`            |

* **Open Tabme quickly:** If Tabme is your new tab page, you can open it anytime by pressing Ctrl+T / ⌘+T to spawn a new tab. If you’re using the Tabme Mini extension, consider setting a custom keyboard shortcut via Chrome’s extensions page (go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`) to open Tabme without clicking the icon.
* **Switch focus to Tabme:** When you open a new tab, Chrome’s address bar is focused by default. Simply hit the `Tab` key once to jump into the Tabme interface. Now you can use arrow keys to move around.
* **Navigate and select:** Use the up/down arrow keys to move the highlight through the list of open tabs or saved items. If folders or spaces are on screen, the arrow keys will navigate those as well (Tabme will intuitively handle the focus). Press **Enter** to open the highlighted item or to execute a focused button (like “Open All” if that’s selected).
* **Close Tabme with keyboard:** After you’re done managing tabs, you can quickly close the Tabme tab by pressing Ctrl+W / ⌘+W, just like closing any browser tab. This will bring you back to whatever you were doing.

*(More advanced shortcuts may be customizable via Settings or Chrome’s shortcuts page – check the Settings section to see if you can modify any key bindings to your liking.)*

### Using Spaces and Workspaces

If you juggle many projects or contexts, Tabme’s **Spaces** feature will be your best friend. Spaces (also sometimes called workspaces) allow you to have separate collections of folders for different needs, all within the same extension:

* **What are Spaces?** Think of Spaces as different desktops for your tabs. For example, you might have a “Work” space that contains folders and tabs related to your job, and a “Personal” space for your home and hobby browsing. When you switch to a different Space, Tabme will show you a different set of folders relevant to that context, helping you focus.
* **Creating and Switching Spaces:** To create a new Space, look for a Space menu or dropdown at the top of the Tabme interface (it might say your current space name, like “Default” or “Personal”). Click it and choose **New Space** (or a "+" icon) to create another one. Give the new Space a name. Now you can drag or create folders under this Space without mixing them with other spaces. To switch spaces, use the same menu and select the Space you want to view – Tabme will instantly swap in the folders for that Space.
* **Using Spaces Efficiently:** Use Spaces to keep unrelated tabs separate. For instance, keep all your work research and links in the “Work” space so that when you’re off the clock, you don’t even see them – you only see your “Personal” space with leisure reading or family to-dos. This reduces distraction and clutter. When it’s time to work, switch to the Work space and you have everything you need in one place.
* **Spaces and Search:** The Smart Search will typically search across all spaces unless specified otherwise, so you won’t lose track of things if you forget which space you put them in. However, to narrow focus, make sure you’re in the intended space when organizing or when manually browsing your folders.
* **Reordering and Removing Spaces:** Just like folders, you might be able to rename spaces or reorder them (depending on Tabme’s UI). You can also delete a space if you no longer need it – just be aware that deleting a space will remove all folders within it, so use caution.

> **Power Tip:** Combine Spaces with Tabme’s export/import features. For example, you could export all data from one Space as a backup or for sharing, then import it into a different profile or machine. This way advanced users can maintain different sets of tabs for different roles or even share a Space’s setup with a teammate (by sharing the exported file).

### Other Handy Tricks

* **Local File Access:** If you need Tabme to manage local file URLs (like files on your computer), you’ll have to grant it extra permission. Go to `chrome://extensions`, find Tabme, and enable “Allow access to file URLs”. Now you can stash local files (like `file:///` links) in Tabme as well.
* **Use Chrome Profiles:** Power users often leverage multiple Chrome profiles (e.g., one for Work, one for Personal) along with Tabme. The good news is you can install Tabme on each profile and keep different sets of Spaces/folders in each, effectively doubling down on organization and preventing any mixing of work vs personal tabs.
* **Sync (Future Tip):** Tabme is working on cloud sync functionality. Once available, you’ll be able to sync your Tabme data across devices seamlessly. In the meantime, you can manually export and import (see next section) to move your setup to another computer or profile if needed.

By taking advantage of these power-user features, you can tailor Tabme to fit even the most demanding workflows, zipping through your tabs and spaces with minimal mouse use.

## Importing and Exporting Tabs

Tabme not only helps you save tabs, but also allows you to bring in tabs from other sources and back up your data. Whether you’re migrating from another tab manager or just want a safety net for your bookmarks, here’s how to use the import/export functionality:

* **Import from Toby (or other managers):** If you’re switching from Toby (another popular tab manager) to Tabme, you can easily bring your saved sessions into Tabme. Toby provides an export option in JSON format. First, export your Toby collections by going to Toby’s account settings and choosing **Export to JSON**. This will download a file (e.g., `toby-export.json`). Then, in Tabme, click on **Settings** and find the **Import** option (it might say “Import from Toby JSON”). Select your Toby JSON file, and Tabme will import all your Toby collections as new folders and notes. In a couple of clicks, your Toby data will appear inside Tabme, ready to use!
* **Import from Chrome Bookmarks:** Maybe you have a bunch of regular Chrome bookmarks and want to give them new life in Tabme. A full synchronization with Chrome’s bookmark system is in the works, but you might currently import a specific bookmarks folder manually. One way is to export your Chrome bookmarks (Chrome can export them as an HTML file) and then use a conversion tool or script, but an easier method: In Tabme’s settings, look for **Import Bookmarks**. If available, it will allow you to pick a Chrome bookmarks folder and import its links into a Tabme folder. This is especially useful to quickly populate Tabme with existing bookmark collections.
* **Exporting Tabme Data:** It’s always good to back up your data. Tabme provides an **Export** function (typically in the Settings menu) that lets you save all your Tabme data (folders, tabs, notes, spaces – everything) into a single file, usually in JSON format. Click **Export Data** and Tabme will generate a file (for example, `tabme-backup.json`) and save it to your computer. You can use this file to restore your setup if you reinstall the extension or move to a new device.
* **Using Export/Import for Sync:** Until automatic syncing is released, you can use the Export and Import features to manually sync across browsers. For instance, export your Tabme data from your work computer, send the file to your home computer, and import it there. Keep in mind this is a one-time snapshot copy; it won’t continuously sync changes, but it’s a handy way to transfer or back up your tab collections periodically.
* **Format and Privacy:** The exported data (JSON) is a text file containing all your saved URLs, note text, folder names, etc. It’s for your use; if you open it, you’ll see it’s mostly human-readable. Rest assured that unless you choose to share that file, your data stays private. When importing, none of the data leaves your machine – it’s processed by the Tabme extension locally to recreate your folders and notes.

> **Tip:** Before uninstalling Tabme or switching between the full and mini versions, always export your data. Since the full Tabme and Tabme Mini are technically separate extensions, they do not automatically share data. However, you can export from one and import into the other to transfer all your saved tabs. This ensures you won’t lose anything during the switch.

In summary, Tabme’s import/export tools give you control over your data and make it easy to move in or out of the ecosystem of other tab managers or browsers.

## Settings and Customization

Tabme offers a variety of settings and customization options so you can tailor the experience to your preferences. To access settings, look for the **gear icon** or a **Settings** option (usually in the upper corner of the Tabme interface or in the extension menu). Here are some key things you can adjust:

* **Dark Mode:** If you often browse at night or prefer darker interfaces, you’ll love Tabme’s Dark Mode. In Settings, toggle **Light/Dark Mode** to switch the entire interface to a dark theme. It’s easier on the eyes in low-light environments and just looks cool. You can switch back to light mode anytime using the same toggle. (Tabme will remember your choice.)
* **Show Archived Items:** By default, archived tabs and folders are hidden from the main view. In Settings, you may find an option to **Show Archived** items. Enabling this will reveal your archived folders/tabs within the interface (often they’ll appear in a separate section or marked distinctly). This is useful if you need to review what you’ve archived or restore something from the archive. When you’re done, you can disable “show archived” to declutter the view again.
* **New Tab Override:** If you ever change your mind about using Tabme as your new tab page, you have a couple of choices. The Tabme extension that overrides new tabs doesn’t have an on/off toggle in settings; instead, you would switch to the alternative version. Uninstall the current version and install **Tabme Mini** (the one that doesn’t take over the new tab) or vice versa. This gives you flexibility depending on your workflow. Remember, you can always open Tabme via its icon or a shortcut if it’s not your new tab default.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts Customization:** While Tabme itself may not have a full shortcuts editor within its UI, Chrome provides one. In the **Chrome Extensions page** (`chrome://extensions/shortcuts`), you can set up custom keys for certain Tabme actions, like opening the extension quickly. Check if Tabme lists any specific commands in that page. If it does, you can assign keys to them. For example, you might create a shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y to open Tabme instantly. This is especially useful for power users using Tabme Mini.
* **Notifications & Sounds:** Depending on Tabme’s features, you might see an option to toggle sound effects or notifications. For instance, if Tabme plays a little “click” sound when you drag and save a tab, you could have an option to disable those sound effects. Similarly, Tabme might not have notifications on its own, but if it ever integrates something like reminders, you’d manage notifications here.
* **Data and Sync Settings:** Currently, Tabme stores your data locally (within Chrome). Future updates might introduce a cloud sync you can log into. For now, your best friend is the manual Export/Import for backup. In settings, you’ll find **Import from file** or **Export to file** options as covered in the previous section. Use these to manage your data portability.
* **Appearance and Layout:** Some customization options might include how Tabme displays your content. For example, toggling whether thumbnails of webpages are shown, or how compact the list is. If you prefer a denser list of items, check if there’s a **compact mode** setting. Tabme is already pretty clean, but little tweaks can make it fit your style. You might also find an option to change the font size or language if needed (likely it follows Chrome’s language by default).
* **Updates and About:** At the bottom of the settings or menu, you might see the version of Tabme you’re running. You can check for updates via the Chrome Web Store (Chrome updates extensions automatically, but it’s nice to know the version). Also, if you ever need support or want to rate Tabme, there may be quick links in settings (like “Contact support” or “Rate us”). Tabme is free, so showing some love via a positive review is always appreciated by the developer!

> **Tip:** Take a moment to explore the Settings when you first install Tabme. A few small tweaks, like enabling dark mode or setting up a keyboard shortcut, can significantly enhance your day-to-day use. And don’t worry – you can’t break anything. If something doesn’t work for you, you can always reset it or turn it off again.

By customizing Tabme’s settings, you ensure the extension works just the way you like, whether that’s in dark mode during late-night study sessions or with a specialized setup for your workflow.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

Here are answers to some common questions and solutions to potential issues you might encounter while using Tabme:

**Q: What is Tabme, and how does it work?**
**A:** Tabme is a Chrome extension designed to make managing your tabs and bookmarks effortless. You can save tabs into folders and use drag-and-drop functionality to arrange them. Tabme also supports color-coding, search, dark mode, and keyboard accessibility to enhance your browsing experience.

**Q: Do I need to create an account to use Tabme?**
**A:** Nope! Tabme is entirely free and works without any account or sign-up. All your data is stored in your browser. (Sync across devices is a planned feature, but currently you don’t need to log in — just install and go.)

**Q: How can I disable or enable Tabme as the new tab page?**
**A:** Tabme comes in two versions: one that replaces the Chrome new tab, and one that doesn’t. If you want to disable the new tab override, install the **Tabme (version without new tab)** from the Chrome Web Store and remove or disable the other version. Conversely, if you want Tabme *to* be your new tab page, make sure you have the main Tabme extension installed (and not the mini version). You can’t toggle it on/off within the extension, but swapping the versions accomplishes the same thing.

**Q: Will my saved tabs in Tabme sync to my other computer or Chrome profile?**
**A:** Not yet. Automatic syncing of Tabme data (through Chrome sync or a cloud account) is in progress and one of the top requested features. For now, Tabme’s data stays on the device where you saved it. If you want to transfer your Tabme setup to another browser or computer, use the **Export** feature on your source device and then **Import** on the target device. It’s an extra step, but it ensures you don’t lose anything between machines until true sync is available.

**Q: How do I import my saved sessions from Toby or another tab manager?**
**A:** Use the import/export feature. For Toby specifically, export your Toby data to a JSON file (via Toby’s settings), then in Tabme go to Settings → Import and choose the Toby JSON file. All your collections should appear as Tabme folders. For other managers or bookmarks, see the “Importing and Exporting Tabs” section above — in many cases you can import bookmarks HTML or use other conversion tools.

**Q: Tabme feels slow or laggy now that I’ve saved hundreds of tabs. What should I do?**
**A:** Tabme is built to handle a lot, but if things feel sluggish, try these steps: (1) Archive old or inactive folders to reduce on-screen clutter. (2) Close any extremely large number of open tabs in Chrome, as the browser itself might be the bottleneck. (3) Make sure you’re running the latest version of Tabme (updates might include performance improvements). 

**Q: I notice some saved tabs are greyed out or marked differently. Why?**
**A:** Tabme may highlight tabs that haven’t been opened in a long time (i.e., “stale” bookmarks) to help you identify what you haven’t looked at yet. This is meant to keep your space clean and manageable. It’s like a gentle reminder that “hey, you saved this a while ago but never opened it.” You can ignore it or use it as a cue to revisit or archive that tab. Nothing is removed automatically — it’s just a visual cue.

**Q: I accidentally deleted a folder or tab in Tabme. Can I undo it?**
**A:** There isn’t an undo button in Tabme for deletions, so deletions are permanent. For this reason, Tabme provides an Archive feature as a safer alternative for cleanup. If you accidentally clicked delete, unfortunately that item is gone unless you have a backup (like an exported file or if the tab is still in your Chrome history). To avoid this, use **Archive** when cleaning up; you can always go to Settings and show archived items to retrieve something, or simply keep it archived if you might need it later.

**Q: How do I give Tabme access to local files on my computer?**
**A:** Chrome blocks extensions from seeing local files by default. If you want Tabme to save or open file:// links (like a PDF on your desktop), go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser, find Tabme in the list, and enable the toggle for “Allow access to file URLs.” After that, Tabme will be able to handle local file links just like normal web links.

**Q: Is Tabme really free to use? What’s the catch?**
**A:** It’s 100% free with no catch! There are no hidden limits or premium tiers. You can save unlimited tabs and notes. The developer created Tabme to help others and there’s no subscription required. If you find Tabme useful, the best “payment” is to leave a nice review on the Chrome Web Store to help others discover it.

**Q: Something isn’t working or I have a suggestion. How can I get help or give feedback?**
**A:** For help or feedback, you can usually find a contact email or form on the Tabme website or the Chrome Web Store listing. Common issues and questions are also addressed in this guide and on the Tabme FAQ page. If you encounter a bug, reaching out to the developer with details (and what browser/OS you’re using) will help them fix it. Tabme is under active development, so user feedback is welcome!
