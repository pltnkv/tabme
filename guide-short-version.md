Tabme Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Tabme — a simple tool to save, organize, and manage your tabs and notes. Here’s everything you need to get started and explore advanced features.

1. Getting Started

Install Tabme from the Chrome Web Store.

Open Tabme from a new tab (full version) or by clicking the icon (Mini version).

Left panel: open tabs. Right panel: saved tabs and folders.

```
NOTE: ⭐️  Tabme replaces the default "new tab," granting you instant access to all your saved tabs.
If you prefer to keep your default new tab page, opt for the "Tabme Mini" extension available on the Chrome Web Store:
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabme-%E2%80%94-organize-tabs-and/jjdbikbbknmhkknpfnlhgpcikbfjldee
It includes all the same features but doesn’t open on every new tab.
```
