# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Framework
- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Tests are colocated next to the tested file
  - Example: `dir/format.ts` and `dir/format.test.ts`

## Best Practices
- Each test should be independent
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up mocks between tests
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Do not mock the Logger
